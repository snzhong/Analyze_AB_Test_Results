# Analyze A/B Test Results
## by Sean Zhong


## Overview

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

My dataset contains the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to determine whether or not the company should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer before making their decision.

As part of my analysis, I conducted some initial data cleaning/wrangling (mismatched conditions, removing duplicates, changing datatypes), as well as conducting hypothesis testing via bootstrapping, statistical testing, and regression modeling.

### Statistical Analysis

- Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations
- Z-core tests
- Logistic regression modeling
- Multiple linear regression modeling to test for interactions of independent variables


## Conclusions

- The conversion rates between the old and new web pages are not significantly different.
- The user's country does not impact the rate of conversion between the old and new web pages.
- An interaction between country and page does not exist.
- Potentially more time needs to be given to the experiment before proper conclusions can be made.
